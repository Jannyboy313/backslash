**The Raycast Clone Your Linux Desktop Deserves**

> **"The failed uncle of the family"** > _Because every family has that one uncle... you know, the one who's a bit of a screw-up but still kind of lovable in his own tragic way. That's Backslash, and Raycast is the golden child. But deep down, we all have a soft spot for the underdog. Right?_

## Introduction

Welcome to **Backslash** – the Linux-only, open-source alternative to Raycast that you didn't know you needed. It's a powerful productivity tool that allows users to quickly search, launch applications, and execute custom commands, all from a sleek, keyboard-driven interface. With its extensible plugin system, Backslash brings the flexibility and customization that Linux users love to the world of productivity launchers.

Sure, Raycast is slick, smooth, and sophisticated. But Backslash? Backslash has **character**. So get comfortable and give it a shot — because Linux users deserve nice things too (even if it’s held together by shell scripts and pure spite).

## Features

Backslash has everything you need, and maybe some things you don’t, but hey, we’re here to impress:

- **Search Everything**: Quickly search through your apps, settings, and more. No more aimlessly clicking through directories like you're playing Minesweeper.
- **Custom Commands**: Make your own commands and feel like a hacker in a 90s movie. It's all just a terminal at the end of the day, right?
- **Snappy and Lightweight**: Just like Linux users like it. No bloat here. Raycast who?
- **Integration-friendly**: Plug in your favorite Linux utilities and scripts. It won’t complain, promise.
- **Keyboard-centric**: Mouse? We barely knew her. Navigate everything with your trusty keyboard like the Linux power user you are.

## Installation

It's simple, really. Even your distro-hopping soul can handle this.

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/backslash-app/backslash/releases).

And just like that, you’re the proud user of Backslash.

## Usage

Once installed, summon the great **Backslash** with a simple keystroke (control + space), and start typing away! You’ll feel like the Linux wizard you were always meant to be.

## No Commands? No Problem!

It's time to add some plugins. Just go to our [plugins repo](https://github.com/backslash-app/plugins), find some code that tickles your fancy, and copy it into a folder of your choosing. It's like grocery shopping, but for nerds.

Once you've got your digital goodies, fire up Backslash and click on that lonely button on the right (Don't worry, it's the only button there. Even a sleep-deprived developer couldn't mess this up).

Then, simply point Backslash to your new plugins folder. Voila! You've just transformed your Backslash from a blank slate into a powerhouse of productivity (or procrastination, we don't judge).

> [!WARNING]
> Remember, this plugins folder must contain plugins, only. We know your dog is adorable and your grandma's birthday bash was epic, but please, keep those photo folders on your personal drive. This is a strict no-pet-pics, no-family-reunion-snapshots zone.

## FAQ

### **Q: Will Backslash be available for macOS or Windows?**

**A:** Hahaha… You're funny. No, it won't. And here’s why: **Linux users deserve nice things too, and we’re tired of sharing.** You see, there are far too many gorgeous, well-polished apps that come out for macOS first, sometimes _maybe_ Windows, but they never give us a second thought. Well, Backslash is here for **us**, and we're keeping it that way.
So if you want your pretty little `.App` file, feel free to check out Raycast, and leave us to our grumbling and bash scripting. No hard feelings. _Kiss, kiss._

### **Q: Is Backslash stable?**

**A:** Ah, stability... It's like asking if your cat will puke on your keyboard (it will). Backslash is currently in **ALPHA**, so, you know, it's stable for a cat that's still learning to walk. But hey, Linux users are known for their love of adventure and for living life on the edge, right? So, buckle up, and join the ride! (Or, you know, just wait until it's not in alpha anymore.)

### **Q: Can I customize Backslash?**

**A:** Of course you can! This is **Linux**. Customization is our birthright. You can add commands, integrate your own scripts, and more. If you break something, that's just part of the fun. Just checkout our amazing [documentation](https://github.com/backslash-app/backslash/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md).

### **Q: Why do you hate Raycast and Mac users?**

**A:** Oh, we don’t hate Raycast at all! In fact, we're huge admirers of their work—that’s precisely why we made a Linux version. Deep down, we know we’re not bringing Backslash to macOS because, well, we’d feel a bit ridiculous next to the real deal.

As for Mac users... Look, we don’t hate you either. It’s just that we, Linux folks, enjoy the challenge of wrestling with open-source, and there’s a special joy in knowing half our hardware only works if we stare at it hard enough. No hard feelings!
